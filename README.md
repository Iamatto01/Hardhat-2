# Sample Hardhat 3 Beta Project (`mocha` and `ethers`)

This project showcases a Hardhat 3 Beta project using `mocha` for tests and the `ethers` library for Ethereum interactions.

## Project Overview

This example project includes:

- A simple Hardhat configuration file.
- Foundry-compatible Solidity unit tests.
- TypeScript integration tests using `mocha` and ethers.js
- Examples demonstrating how to connect to different types of networks, including locally simulating OP mainnet.

## Usage

### Running Tests

To run all the tests in the project, execute the following command:

```shell
npx hardhat test
```

You can also selectively run the Solidity or `mocha` tests:

```shell
npx hardhat test solidity
npx hardhat test mocha
```

### Make a deployment to Sepolia

This project includes an example Ignition module to deploy the contract. You can deploy this module to a locally simulated chain or to Sepolia.

To run the deployment to a local chain:

```shell
```

To run the deployment to Sepolia, you need an account with SepoliaETH to pay gas.

This repo expects:
- `SEPOLIA_RPC_URL` (or `HARDHAT_VAR_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL`)
- `SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY` (or `HARDHAT_VAR_SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY`)

You can also create a local `.env` file (copy `.env.example` to `.env`). The Hardhat config loads it automatically.

You can set the `SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY` variable using the `hardhat-keystore` plugin or by setting it as an environment variable.

To set the `SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY` config variable using `hardhat-keystore`:

```shell
npx hardhat keystore set SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY
```

After setting the variables, deploy with:

```shell
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network sepolia
```
